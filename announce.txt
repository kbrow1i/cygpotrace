Subject: potrace 1.14-1

The following packages have been uploaded to the Cygwin distribution:

* potrace-1.14-1
* libpotrace0-1.14-1
* libpotrace-devel-1.14-1

Potrace is a tool for tracing a bitmap, which means, transforming a
bitmap into a smooth, scalable image.  The input is a bitmap (PBM,
PGM, PPM, or BMP), and the default output is one of several vector
file formats.  A typical use is to create EPS files from scanned data,
such as company or university logos, handwritten notes, etc.  The
resulting image is not jaggy like a bitmap, but smooth.  It can then
be rendered at any resolution.

This is an update of potrace to the latest upstream release.  The
packages libpotrace0 and libpotrace-devel are new with this release.
